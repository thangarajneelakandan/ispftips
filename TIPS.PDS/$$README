This PDS contains the sample code that is referenced in the ISPF Tips
and Tricks publication. Code snippets are not included here as the
snippets are short examples.

An ISPF dialog has been provided to simplify access to these examples.
   2. Execute the $DEVISPF exec

See TIPS.XMIT for files that must be received and installed to be used.
See member $$XMIT for information on how to do this.

To experiment with these copy the REXX members into a library included in
your SYSEXEC (or SYSPROC) concatenation, and copy the Panel members into
a library in your ISPPLIB concatenation.

Member naming convention:
    $$   Informational members
    $    Code use to drive the driver ISPF application
    #    Members in TSO Transmit format
    JC   JCL members
    PN   Panel members
    RX   Rexx members
    CMT and LOADISPF are included as is
    S    Sample members used by sample code

Member types by ID:
